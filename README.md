# Time-Series-Modelling-Case-Study
A Comparative Case Study on Modelling and Predictive Power of ARIMA and LSTM Models on Time Series Data

Assignment Tasks:

 Read assignment brief and understand what data and models we will be using
Make initial plots of the data
Perform all the time series analysis tasks to test for non-stationarity
Make the data stationary
Define an ARMA model
Find the best model parameters: p,d,q
Test model performance
Forecast model 24 months into the future
Repeat for both data sets
Build an RNN based model (LSTM, GRU)
Model and forecast 24 months into the future
Make plots of the models
Compute evaluation metrics
Write a 4-6 page report describing the modelling, forecasts and inferences. This includes figures and references.
